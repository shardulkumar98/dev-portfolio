    <div className="font-oxygen md:text-lg">
      As a MERN stack developer, I specialize in crafting dynamic web
      applications using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. My
      portfolio showcases projects that demonstrate expertise in full-stack
      development, from building RESTful APIs with Express to creating
      responsive interfaces with React. I prioritize user experience,
      implementing smooth navigation and responsive layouts. Accessibility and
      performance are paramount, with optimization techniques employed to ensure
      fast loading times. I excel in integrating third-party services, such as
      OAuth for authentication and payment gateways. Collaboration and
      communication are central to my approach, as I work closely with clients
      and team members to deliver solutions that exceed expectations. Committed
      to continuous learning, I stay updated with the latest technologies to
      innovate in web development. In summary, my portfolio reflects a track
      record of delivering high-quality, innovative web solutions that combine
      functionality with aesthetics to provide exceptional user experiences.
